# DIY-YOLO-R-workflow-
This repository comprises the sample images necessary to execute the Do-It-Yourself version of the workflow outlined by Petroni et al., provided as an R script alongside the paper. The DIY flow allows both YOLO training and inference using a limited set of images gathered from three distinct camera trap sites in the Apuan Alps, with a focus on three target species of carnivores: the European badger, wolf, and martens (considered as a higher-order category encompassing both stone marten and pine marten).
# DIY Expected results
Each training folder contains 30 pictures, whereas the inference folders contain 10 images. It's worth noting that such a small number of training images won't yield reliable results in terms of model accuracy. Nevertheless, the primary objective of the Do-It-Yourself workflow is to empower users to implement the procedures and grasp the mechanisms involved in the workflow.

This repository also stores a pre-trained model for 17 target categories of wild and domestic European mammals, plus humans and vehicles. The model was trained on camera trap data collected in the Apuan Alps (Central Italy). Further details on model training are available in Petroni et al.
