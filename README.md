# DIY-YOLO-R-workflow-
This repository comprises the sample images necessary to execute the Do-It-Yourself version of the workflow outlined by Petroni et al., provided as an R script alongside the paper. The DIY flow allows both YOLO training and inference using a limited set of images gathered from three distinct camera trap sites in the Apuan Alps, with a focus on three target species of carnivores: the European badger, wolf, and martens (considered as a higher-order category encompassing both stone marten and pine marten).
# Expected results
Each training folder contains 30 pictures, whereas the inference folders contain 10 images. It's worth noting that such a small number of training images won't yield reliable results in terms of model accuracy. Nevertheless, the primary objective of the Do-It-Yourself workflow is to empower users to implement the procedures and grasp the mechanisms involved in the workflow.
