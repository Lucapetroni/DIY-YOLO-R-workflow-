# DIY-YOLO-R-workflow-
This repo contains the R script and sample images to implement the Do-It-Yourself version of the workflow from Petroni et al. The DIY flow allows both YOLO training and inference on a small set of images collected at three different camera trap sites in the Apuan Alps, focusing on three target carnivores.
